<h1>First Mods</h1>
<p>There's many paths you can take when modding your Subaru.
      One main mod I always suggest is the Killer B oil pan kit.
    It has many great benefits and helps prevent oil starvation.</p>

        body {
                font-family: arial;

<h1>Using Internal CSS</h1>
<p>Following the oil pan upgrade, I suggest you start investing in some bushings for your shifter.
        it makes a world of difference and it has a great feel!</p>
