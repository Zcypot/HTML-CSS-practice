<!--main story-->

<p>The main goal for my WRX is simple,
      keep it looking as stock as possible and put the power down to the ground and quickly as possible.</p>

      <p> I want Savitar to be quick and responsive.  Slowly I am building it up to be the perfect street car for me.<br />
            There is no point on have a ton of power, if I can't access it readidly.<br />
              For this reason I want to push
            the Ej255 motor to it's limits.  Getting the Turbo to spool early without Dual AVSC will be difficult, 
            but I am sure AQMotorSports will figure something out.
