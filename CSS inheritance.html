    <h1>Maintenance</h1>
        <p> Don't ever cheap out on your maintenance, this inclues giving your engine inspections often.
              Small leaks can develop and cause the car to run richer or leaner, and inspecting the hoses
            is a good way to stay on top of it.</p>

        <p>Many speedshops can perform a smoke test, or you can build your own kit.
              The point of this is to send pressurized smoke through the charge system and expose any leaks that are hard to see.</p>
